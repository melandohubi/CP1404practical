# Pythonic Project Management

A simple project management application built in Python that allows users to manage projects, including loading from a file, saving to a file, displaying projects, filtering by date, adding new projects, and updating existing ones.

## Features

- Load projects from a CSV file.
- Save projects to a CSV file.
- Display all projects, categorized by completion status.
- Filter projects based on their start date.
- Add new projects interactively.
- Update existing project details.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Standard library modules: `csv`, `datetime`

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the source code:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/project-management.git
   cd project-management
   ```

2. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Usage

1. Prepare a CSV file named `projects.txt` with the following format:
   ```
   Project Name, Start Date (dd/mm/yyyy), Priority (integer), Cost (float), Completion (integer)
   ```

   Example:
   ```
   Project Alpha, 01/01/2023, 1, 1000.50, 50
   Project Beta, 15/02/2023, 2, 1500.00, 100
   ```

2. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python project_management.py
   ```

3. Follow the on-screen menu to manage your projects:
   - **(L)** Load existing projects.
   - **(S)** Save current projects to a file.
   - **(D)** Display all projects.
   - **(F)** Filter projects by start date.
   - **(A)** Add a new project.
   - **(U)** Update an existing project's details.
   - **(Q)** Quit the application.
