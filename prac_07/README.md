CP1404 Practicals
About This Repository
This repository contains solutions and code samples developed as part of the CP1404/CP5632 Practical Programming subject. It covers core Python programming concepts such as object-oriented programming (OOP), file I/O, data structures, sorting, testing, and more.

Lessons Learned About Clean Code
* Consistent Naming and Structure: Naming conventions and consistent indentation make the code much more readable and maintainable.
* Modularization: Breaking functionality into small, well-defined functions and classes improves clarity and reusability.
* Docstrings and Comments: Adding docstrings and inline comments makes it easier for others (and future me!) to understand what each part of the code does.
Projects Included
* Programming Language Class: A class that represents programming languages with methods to test dynamic typing.
* Guitar Inventory Manager: Uses file I/O and object comparison to load, display, and update guitar objects.
* Project Tracker: Allows filtering, displaying, and updating projects, sorted by priority and start date.
* Language CSV Reader: Demonstrates reading a CSV file into custom objects and using both the csv module and namedtuple.
