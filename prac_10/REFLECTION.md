CP1404 Practical Reflection
Estimates
How was your estimate accuracy usually?

My estimate accuracy varied throughout the course, often depending on the complexity of the task. In the earlier weeks, particularly with simpler tasks like functions and lists, my estimates were fairly close. However, as we progressed to more complex topics like OOP and APIs, I found my estimates to be less accurate due to unforeseen challenges and intricacies in the code.

How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

Over time, I became more adept at breaking down tasks into smaller components, which improved my estimation skills. By week 10, I had developed a better understanding of how long specific coding tasks would take, especially after gaining experience with APIs and GUI programming. This experience helped me refine my approach to estimating time and effort more realistically.

What did you learn from doing these estimates?

I learned that making accurate estimates requires not only an understanding of the task at hand but also an awareness of my own coding speed and problem-solving abilities. Additionally, I discovered the importance of factoring in potential obstacles and debugging time, which can significantly affect the overall timeline.

Code Reviews

What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

Being reviewed by others highlighted areas where I could improve my coding practices and emphasized the importance of writing clear, maintainable code. Feedback from peers often provided new perspectives on problem-solving and introduced me to alternative approaches that I hadn't considered.

What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

Conducting code reviews taught me to critically evaluate code for clarity, efficiency, and adherence to best practices. It reinforced my understanding of coding standards and helped me develop a more analytical mindset when approaching programming tasks. I also learned how to provide constructive feedback that encourages improvement rather than discouragement.

Good Code Review 1

PR #1 - Example Review

Explanation

In this review, I focused on providing specific feedback regarding code readability and suggested improvements for function naming conventions. This helped the author understand how to make their code clearer for future maintainers.

Good Code Review 2

PR #2 - Example Review

Explanation

This review emphasised best practices in error handling and encouraged the use of exceptions in a more structured way. By highlighting these aspects, I aimed to improve the robustness of the code while also fostering a discussion about error management strategies.

Practicals

Regarding the practical tasks overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

If I were in charge of the subject, I would incorporate more collaborative projects that require teamwork. This could enhance peer learning and provide students with experience working in environments similar to real-world software development settings. Additionally, introducing more frequent checkpoints or mini-assessments could help students gauge their understanding throughout the course.

What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

I excelled in actively participating in discussions during practical sessions and consistently sought feedback on my work. My proactive approach allowed me to clarify doubts early on and adapt my learning strategies effectively. Furthermore, I maintained a strong focus on writing clean and organized code, which facilitated easier debugging and collaboration with peers.
