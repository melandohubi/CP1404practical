## CP1404 Practical Reflection

### What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

I've started to take a more organized approach to my studies. I now create detailed outlines for my assignments and break them down into smaller, manageable tasks. This helps me stay focused and reduces the feeling of being overwhelmed. Additionally, I've made it a point to ask questions more frequently, whether in class or during office hours, which has really helped clarify my understanding of complex topics.

### What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

I need to work on my time management skills. While I’ve improved in some areas, I still find myself cramming for deadlines instead of spreading out my work over the week. I also want to cultivate a more positive mindset when facing challenging assignments. Instead of getting frustrated, I should remind myself that struggling with tough concepts is part of the learning process.

### What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I’ve been effective at collaborating with my classmates during group projects. Sharing ideas and troubleshooting together has not only made the work more enjoyable but has also deepened my understanding of the material. I plan to continue fostering these collaborative relationships as they enhance both my learning experience and my teamwork skills.

### What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I need to stop procrastinating on assignments and studying. Waiting until the last minute often leads to rushed work and a lack of thorough understanding. By starting tasks earlier and setting specific goals for each study session, I can improve my grasp of the material and reduce stress.

### What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

I would love to see more hands-on workshops or practical coding sessions integrated into the curriculum. These experiences would allow us to apply what we learn in class to real-world scenarios, making the material more relevant and engaging. This kind of practical exposure would better prepare us for future careers in IT.
