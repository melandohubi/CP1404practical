## Overview

This repository contains several Kivy applications demonstrating basic GUI functionality using the Kivy framework. Each application serves a different purpose, such as converting distances, greeting users, dynamically creating labels, and squaring numbers.

### Applications Included

1. **Miles to Kilometers Converter**: Converts miles to kilometers based on user input.
2. **Greeting Application**: Prompts the user to enter their name and displays a greeting.
3. **Dynamic Labels App**: Creates and displays labels dynamically based on a predefined list of names.
4. **Square Number App**: Takes a number input from the user and calculates its square.

## Requirements

- Kivy library

You can install Kivy using pip:

```bash
pip install kivy
```
